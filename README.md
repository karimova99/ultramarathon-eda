# Ultra-Marathon EDA (2016–2019)

A Jupyter Notebook exploring ~2.5 million ultramarathon finishers from 2016–2019 to uncover:
- **Participation Trends** by year, season, distance, and gender  
- **Performance Patterns** (average speed, finish time distributions)  
- **Demographics** (age and gender profiles)  
- **Seasonality & Geography** (when/where the fastest races occur)  

## 📊 Key Findings
1. **Spring** hosts the most races and yields the fastest average paces.  
2. **Prime performance age** is 25–45 years, with speeds tapering after 50.  
3. East/Central African runners dominate mean speeds (~11–13 km/h vs a global ~8 km/h).
